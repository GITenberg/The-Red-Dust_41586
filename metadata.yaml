description: '"You who have read ''The Mad Planet'' by Murray Leinster, will welcome
  the sequel to that story. The world, in a far distant future, is peopled with huge
  instects and titanic fungus growths. Life has been greatly altered, and tiny Man
  is now in the process of becoming acclimated to the change. We again meet our hero
  Burl, but this time a far greater danger menaces the human race. The huge insects
  are still in evidence, but the terror they inspire is nothing compared to the deadly
  Red Dust. You will follow this remarkable story with breathless interest."'
